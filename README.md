# V2V-COMMUNICATION-POTHOLE
Our project presents a pioneering approach to vehicular communication, leveraging cutting-edge technology to revolutionize road safety. Through the seamless integration of ultrasonic sensors, NRF modules, LCD displays, and Arduino microcontrollers, our system enables real-time transmission of alert messages between vehicles within a hundred-centimeter range. With a user-friendly interface and scalable architecture, our solution not only enhances driver awareness but also promotes collaboration within the open-source community to continually improve and expand the capabilities of this vital innovation.
